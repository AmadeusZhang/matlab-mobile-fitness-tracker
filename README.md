# MATLABthon POLIMI @May 2023

Under the theme of implementing a functionality for fitness tracker we aim to implement feature of "cadence visualizer" (so displaying how many steps per minute).

At the early stages we have used the steps calculator provided inside the example, but we were intended to implement a ML model to compute an accurate stride length, 
to do so we have collected a fixed stride frequency sample aiming to perform a ML model but due to lack of acknowledge of time-series data and ML, the task is not completed.

Sensor data are collected with MATLAB Mobile, we have collected data in different pattern (walking, jogging, sprint) to test the functionality (we know in priori what are average of cadence for these patterns).
