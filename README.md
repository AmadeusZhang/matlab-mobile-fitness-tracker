# Create Your Own Fitness Tracker with MATLAB Online and MATLAB Mobile
This repository consists of the files required, to help you create your own Fitness tracker with MATLAB Online and MATLAB Mobile.

### Instructions Phase 2.docx
This is the guide with detailed steps to help your team use MATLAB Mobile and MATLAB Online to create your fitness tracker. We have also included a simple example that you can use to start with or draw inspiration from as you create your own solution to this challenge!

### PhaseTwo_GradingRubric.docx
This document provides grading rubric for the challenge. The two criteria’s you can use to grade the submissions are the “Fitness Tracker MATLB Model” and the “Presentation format”. We included the grading scheme for both the criteria’s you can use, in this document. 

### ExampleModel.mlx 
This is a MATLAB LiveScript that compiles the workflows shown in this instructions document into a code example on how to process data acquired from a MATLAB Mobile session in order to make meaningful conclusions. 

### ExampleData.mat 
This is a MATLAB data file containing a set of sensor data previously acquired using the workflow demonstrated in the “Collecting Data” section of this document. 

### timeElapsed.m 
This is a helper MATLAB function used in the example model to transform an array containing the date and time of the data points collected, to an array of the time elapsed since the acquisition was started
